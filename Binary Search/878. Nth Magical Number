/* 878. Nth Magical Number

A positive integer is magical if it is divisible by either a or b.

Given the three integers n, a, and b, return the nth magical number. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 1, a = 2, b = 3
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: n = 4, a = 2, b = 3
Output: 6
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 109
2 <= a, b <= 4 * 104 */

/* Binary search on the numbers to find the nth magical number. 
start is min of a,b as number should be divisible by a or b
end is n*min(a,b) to get the nth number
get the position of magical number found = (count of nums divisible by a till mid) + (count of nums divisible by b till mid) - (count of nums which are divisible by both a,b)
